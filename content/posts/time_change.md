We've handed back that hour we took from the UK back in October. When the clocks went forward in the UK last weekend, they went back an hour here. Time difference is now +9hrs. It now gets dark at 6.15pm, which is a shock to the system.

Although we've been making the most of our weekends we have been working during the week, so we're glad to say we've got a break planned for next week. The plan is to fly to Adelaide this Friday night, do a 2 day tour of Kangaroo Island, then a 3Â½ day road trip from Adelaide to Melbourne - the famous Great Ocean Road (both tours are with tried and trusted Wayward Bus.)

We get to Melbourne on Thursday, and will spend Easter weekend catching up with friends plus doing some general sightseeing. We'll fly back to Sydney on Easter Monday, back at work on Tuesday 13 April.

Hope you have a great Easter holiday! And let's all hope that Manchester United beat Arsenal in the F.A.Cup semi-final on Saturday. Arsenal might deserve to win everything this season, but that's hardly the point....
