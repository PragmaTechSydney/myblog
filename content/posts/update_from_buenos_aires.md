We've finished in Patagonia now, and instead of taking a 50+ hour bus journey to get up to Buenos Aires, we took the 4 hour flight option instead. Well, you would, wouldn't you? Anyway, I'm getting ahead of myself.

Patagonia was awesome, one of the best parts of the whole trip. Best part was Torres del Paine National Park in Southern Chile, a collection of mountains, glaciers, valleys, granite pillars, turquiose lakes and general loveliness. If you get the chance, go there - you won't regret it. We spent five days doing a route called the W, which took in most of the park's highlights. Although it was hard going, we didn't have to carry food or tents (that would've been too hard!), as cabins are set up as strategic points along the way. Gush, gush, gush!!

Anyways, we're now up in Buenos Aires, and its a great city. Had a US$5 meal yesterday, which included bread, starter, steak dinner, coffee and a glass of wine. Now you can't argue with that. Emily is currently shopping in the commercial district, which gives me a chance to update this site and start looking for a job. Not long to go now...20 full days left! Eek!

_2023 Update: photos from this trip were uploaded to Flickr a couple of years later, here are snaps from [Patagonia](https://www.flickr.com/photos/philliecasablanca/sets/72157603774802266/) and [Argentina](https://www.flickr.com/photos/philliecasablanca/sets/72157603257725711/), and a link to the collection for the whole trip can be found [here](https://www.flickr.com/photos/philliecasablanca/collections/72157603189229392/)._
