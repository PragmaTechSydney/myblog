So we’re camped out here at Barcamp London 4, at GCap’s offices overlooking Leicester Square, and it’s just fab. So far, today, I have learned how to time travel, make the perfect cup of coffee, break the internet and make a [Nabaztag](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nabaztag) swear.

My talk about the [Ten Commandments of Twitter](http://www.twitter.com/tencommandments) went down well. And, for the first time, I won a game of [werewolf](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mafia_%28game%29) (playing as a werewolf, no less). I didn’t do so well at [Faceball](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faceball), though.
