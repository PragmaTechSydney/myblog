Happy New Year!

This is the first of a few catch-up posts. I spent most of December travelling around Australia, catching up with friends in Melbourne and Sydney, and driving along the coast inbetween.

It was a great trip, and we got to see a corner of Australia we missed out on [last time](http://www.flickr.com/photos/philliecasablanca/sets/72157603188660518/). Highlights along the coast were Wilson’s Prom (a lovely national park at the Southern-most point of mainland Australia)...

With heaps of animals...

...some more friendly than others...

...we stayed in some cool cabins along the coast (this one was only A$95 a night!)...

...and had a few jellyfish encounters...

...but Sydney (with apologies to Melburnians) was the real jewel in the crown. It was great to visit old haunts, as well as catching up with old friends. And the harbour...oh, the harbour...

In short, well worth the effort! Several have asked how we managed this with two very small children in tow, I’ll post about that separately. In the meantime, here’s to 2009 and saying [goodbye to George](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/7809160.stm)!
