I've been doing some much needed house-keeping on this website (much of which won't be evident at a glance), including a revision of the Round-the-world trip photos page. This took ages, mainly due to my inability to write code properly, but still I doubt whether anyone will see it unless I post to it from here.

So click on the below thumbnail for a photography bonanza. (2023 update: this blog post was originally published on my own server, and you can see how awful it looked on the [Wayback Machine](https://web.archive.org/web/20060220153813/http://philwhitehouse.com/). The photos though are now on [Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/philliecasablanca/collections/72157603189229392/))
