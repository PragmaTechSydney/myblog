First off, sorry I haven't been able to upload any more photos from our trip to the site. I'm amazed that anyone is even watching to be honest, but its been lovely getting emails saying that people are interested - thank you. Will aim to get started in January.

I've been very busy at Oyster Partners, which is partly why I haven't had enough time to sort out the photos. The job is going well, the people are great, the work is interesting and I'm hoping to make a career of it here. We'll see how things go in the new year.

And I'd better get back to work. Hope everyone has a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year. Bye!
