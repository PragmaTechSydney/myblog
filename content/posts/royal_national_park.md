This was a busy weekend! My friend at work (Mark) is the outdoor type, and invited us along on a 30km walk down the coastal path of the Royal National Park with some friends. There weren't many facilities along the way, which meant we had to carry our own water and tents. I must admit I would prefer to do it without the heavy packs next time - we felt like we were on army maneuvers! - but it was a brilliant experience and the scenery was amazing. Great bunch of guys to do it with, too. We were very lucky with the weather, and I've uploaded some photos [here](https://www.flickr.com/photos/philliecasablanca/sets/72177720310119456).

Two weeks to go until we leave Sydney....
