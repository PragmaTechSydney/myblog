After working on a secret project for the past year or so, I can finally share the big news that Iâ€™ve been helping an exciting start-up get off the ground - and we launch today! Itâ€™s a groundbreaking new web app in the entertainment industry, which connects Casting Directors, Agents and Artists through the casting process. And itâ€™s called [Altai](https://www.altaicasting.com/)!

The best thing about this project has been working with the founders - Josh comes from Casting, and Renee worked as an agent (and ran an acting college), so they know the industry and processes inside and out. The project was born from a deep frustration with the current products in this space, none of which provide a fully integrated service or a mobile friendly experience. The industry has been crying out for disruption, and our focus has been on providing a superior, connected, accessible and streamlined user experience at every turn.

Iâ€™ve also - as part of the PragmaTech model - been fortunate enough to tap into my network to find the talent needed to get this up and off the ground. Big shout out to the whole team, whoâ€™ve produced some of the best work Iâ€™ve ever seen (and thatâ€™s saying something). This platform has bought everything under one URL - beautiful artist profiles, project and role management, candidate submissions, session management, auditions (including video capture and storage, no plugins or separate software required), Self-tape handling, Status management, Client portals, and much more. To get this done in a year has been a truly phenomenal effort.

Weâ€™ve launched in Australia and New Zealand, with a roadmap to expand our functionality and launch overseas in 2023. To help on this exciting journey, Iâ€™ve joined Altai as Chief Digital Officer on a flexible basis, which means Iâ€™ll still be servicing my other awesome PragmaTech customers.

Iâ€™d like to finish with a note of thanks - Josh and Renee have put a huge amount of trust in me and the team, and weâ€™re all stoked to join you at the start line! Letâ€™s GO! ðŸ™Œ
