description: Some choice albums
---

Since beginning my [journey back into physical media](/posts/compactdiscs), I've been regularly excited to discover music from the 60s-80s that blows me away. It really is astonishing how much amazing music was created from 1967-1973, and either side. And it can't be a coincidence that the quality of music has gone through the floor in the past 20 years (with a few exceptions of course!), as the distraction of the internet takes potential musicians away from perfecting their craft, and towards disposable media.

Anyway, with that old man Whitehouse rant out of the way, I thought I'd share a few of the amazing albums I've discovered. In some cases they're artists I was aware of but didn't realise how incredible their back catalogue was. In others, I didn't know their music at all. And some I hadn't even heard of - but I'm glad I do now!

In no particular order:

### Steely Dan - Canâ€™t Buy a Thrill

Of all the new groups I've encountered, Steely Dan are the one I've listened to the most. They created seven albums from 1972-1980, all of which are incredible. They had a maniacal focus on production quality, regularly bringing in the best session musicians they could lay their hands on and then firing them when they couldn't produce exactly what was needed. Kind of like a musical version of Stanley Kubrick. Zero compromise.

But with seven albums to pick from, where should you start? You could begin with their most famous and successful album, Aja, or maybe even the follow up Gaucho - this was where they had really refined their craft to perfection. But for sheer enjoyment, I prefer their wonderful debut, Can't Buy a Thrill. Every song is catchy AF, and it's easily the one I've played the most. Their third album, Pretzel Logic, is also a great on-ramp, but I'm going to be disciplined and only pick one from each artist....

### Free - Fire and Water

Everyone knows 'All Right Now', but I would wager not many folks could name another song by Free. Which is what made this album one of the strongest hidden gems I've come across. My interest was first piqued when shazaming a lovely song from the TV show [Devs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devs). Found a youtube clip below, feast your eyes and ears on this:

Oh man, when the guitar kicks in at 2:32 it makes my hair stand on end...just lovely stuff...and it turns out the whole album is just as exquisite. Like a lot of great bands, Free initially made their name as one of the British blues explosion, but heaven knows why they've fallen off the radar since then. Their other later albums are also really good.

Note to self: must watch Devs for a third time...

### Boston - Boston

I follow a few 'classic rock' groups on Quora, and noticed that Boston's debut album was frequently mentioned as one of the best. OK, I thought, let's give it a go. I only really knew them for 'More than a feeling', which to be fair is a certified banger, but I was surprised to find there were even better tracks on the album. Fantastic harmonies, catchy hooks and fun lyrics - what's not to like? Personal favourite from this album would be 'Peace of Mind', which you can [check out on Youtube here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edwk-8KJ1Js&ab_channel=BostonVEVO).

And if you dig that, you'll find their second album 'Don't Look Back' is almost as good, especially the [title track](https://youtu.be/XmU4Xyl00hY).
