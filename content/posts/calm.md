Ah, the calm before the storm...!

So any concern about the baby being born too early has now abated, and we've done all our important jobs, so it's eerily calm. Strange to think that the baby must come out within the next three weeks or so. They'll induce the baby 12 days after the due date if it isn't out by then, so it will out by 15 September whatever happens!
