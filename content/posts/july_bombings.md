This posting is mainly for the benefit of friends and family living abroad.

Fortunately no-one we know was involved in the attacks on 7/7 and 21/7, but like most Londoners it is affecting our commute and our way of thinking. It now turns out that I was pulling into Kings Cross on the Victoria Line just as the bomb went off on the train leaving the station on the Piccadilly Line. I pass through Warren Street every day on the Victoria Line. Emily works 100 yards from Aldgate East. We used Stockwell Station just before the first set of blasts. And I'm sure most Londoners have similar stories.

And just this morning, I saw someone a man with a package acting suspiciously at Fulham Broadway station - he came down onto our platform, saw he'd missed the train we'd just got off, and decided to go over to the other platform going in the opposite direction. I told the police and it was reassuring to see them move with purpose and authority - they were last seen searching the guy. As we walked away from the station, several more policemen arrived. Better to be safe than sorry. I'm sure dozens of people are being treated with suspicion, but the alternative is far worse.

It looks like more problems are taking place today, so if anyone looks here to find out how we're getting on, we're both at home today on annual leave. No plans to go out. If there are more attacks, today or in the future, I'll be posting on this site quickly to confirm that we're OK.

Anyway, on a lighter note, Emily's pregnancy is going just fine. She's just coming to the end of week 34, still looking and feeling great, and only has three weeks of work left before she officially becomes a lady of leisure. Alright for some, isn't it?

We've had three ante-natal classes, just one left, and have learned all about pain relief and unusual problems. The former was slightly alarming, as obviously they have to tell you about the pain before the relief, but at least we had a chance to try the gas and air! It's also been interesting finding out that all the women have experienced similar, interesting symptoms of pregnancy, including itchiness (all over the body to start with, then localised to the stomach) and odd dreams about giving birth to things like cats!

There are now 6 weeks and 2 days until the due date, although they make it very clear that the baby is considered "full term" (i.e. ready for birth) from about week 37.

The house is sorted too. We've completed a long list of jobs, including fitting new carpet - which looks great - and our roof has been fixed following the hailstorm a few weeks ago.

So, all in all, we're nearly ready. Should be good!
