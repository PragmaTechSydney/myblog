I love the fact that the fourth plinth in Trafalgar Square is used for exhibiting work by contemporary artists. It sends such a great message to tourists. It would be so easy to put another statue on there, but I think it sends a much more powerful message; that Britain focuses on the present and the future as well as our illustrious past.

The latest occupant of the fourth plinth is called “Model for a Hotel 2007”. I took some snaps as I went past the other night, you can see these [here](https://www.flickr.com/photos/philliecasablanca/albums/72157603189392364).

It’s worth pausing for a moment to consider the esteemed company it finds itself in; the other three plinths hold statues of George IV, Henry Havelock and Sir Charles James Napier, not to mention the [main man himself](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nelson%27s_Column). All fascinating characters, and with the obvious exception of Nelson, I doubt whether most people could name the people on the other plinths. I’m ashamed to say I had to look them up, and I walk past them every day. And so if the unusual artwork draws attention to the other guys, and the notable part they played in our history, that’s got to be a good thing.

Yay, London!
