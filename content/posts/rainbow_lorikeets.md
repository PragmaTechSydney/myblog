A few more photos have been uploaded to the photos page. [Rainbow Lorikeets keep coming up to our balcony for breakfast](https://www.flickr.com/photos/philliecasablanca/2049742831/in/album-72157603245789710/), which is a novelty. And I'm sure it will continue to be so until Emily gets fed up clearing up their bird mess afterwards / putting food out for them in the first place....

Since last time we've been to the Big Day Out festival, and the clear highlight was [The Darkness](https://www.flickr.com/photos/philliecasablanca/2050527400/in/album-72157603245789710/). We were honoured to be right down the front.

Also it was Australia Day on 26 January, when they filled the harbour with hundreds of boats and had a huge race to see who can get to the bridge first. Its a wonder that no-one crashed. Unfortunately I didn't get any great photos during the race, but I've uploaded some before and after shots to the photos page, which gives you an idea of how nice the harbour looked.
