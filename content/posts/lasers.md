Question: What do you get when you cross nine Osmosoftians with a light wand, an optic fibre brush, frickinâ€™ lasers and some long camera exposures? Answer: good clean geeky fun. Heaps of cool photos (all taken by Paul Downey and Phil Hawksworth) can be seen [here](https://www.flickr.com/photos/philliecasablanca/albums/72157603247942259).
