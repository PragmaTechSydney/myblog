Plans are still on track, but only just...

I'd be lying if I said we weren't worried about the SARS virus. The way things are at the moment, our itinerary reads like a SARS tour - the virus has hit all the countries we're visiting in South East Asia, with the only exception being Cambodia. Thailand is even refusing to admit people from other infected countries unless they promise to wear masks for the duration of their stay, in an attempt to contain the problem. Should make border crossing that little bit more interesting.

We're definitely not postponing our trip at this stage, but we might end up tweaking it to avoid the worst areas if it continues to get worse at its present pace. Updates will appear here.
