It's been a busy few weeks - after I got a permanent job, we started looking for houses, saw one we liked, put in an offer, offer rejected, put in a better offer, offer accepted! It's in Raynes Park, just past Wimbledon on the way out of London. We're due to exchange contracts on 18 March and move on 1 April. Fingers crossed we'll be having barbeques in the garden before we know it.
