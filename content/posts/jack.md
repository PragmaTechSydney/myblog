Jack Whitehouse was born at 4.40am this morning, weighing 9lbs exactly! Emily was a star, it was a quick labour with no pain relief (not even gas and air). Mother and baby are doing well.

I prefer not to share details about my family on the web, so I won’t be adding any more here. Suffice to say though that we’re thrilled to bits!
