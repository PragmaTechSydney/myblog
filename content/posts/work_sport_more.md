We haven't been on the road since we last wrote, so this will be just a quick update.

We're now both gainfully employed. Emily is working for Bovis Lendlease (global construction company), and is loving the new team that she's working with. Phil is doing IT project management work for News Interactive, part of Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation group. Details provided on request. He hasn't seen Rupert yet, but if he does he'll be sure to say hello from all of you.

Phil has joined a local 5-a-side football team, called Atletico Manly (Manly is a suburb near where we live). Phil likes the team name because it implies he is athletic and manly. Current form: P3 W0 D1 L2 (played, won, drawn, lost). Will keep you advised.

The Rugby World Cup has been fun up to now, and is just getting interesting. However from the way the local press have mauled the English team you'd think England had lost all their games. As it is we're on track for a quarter final against Wales and a likely semi-final against France. Bring it on.

The Matrix: Can those of you planning to participate in the global synchronised general release of the third and final Matrix film (official website is here) please let Phil have your mobile phone numbers. Phil will be anxious to compare notes with someone afterwards, and as the film is scheduled to finish at 3.30am Sydney time, on a school night, Emily is hotly tipped to fall asleep in the cinema. Especially as we have tickets to watch the second Matrix film at the cinema beforehand. And the first Matrix film at home on DVD before that.... (Phil says: be still my beating heart!)

Visitors: Wai-Ching has now moved onto New Zealand, but Nish has arrived in Australia and is due to arrive in Sydney on 11 November. Emily's cousin Nicola is due to arrive soon. And Matt & Julia are coming over early next year. If you don't know these people, then sorry; if you do, then now you know!

In other news: Barbeque season is officially up and running. Throw another shrimp, etc. And if you're in the UK and wondering where your missing hour goes when the clock goes back, we can reveal that it comes down here. Time difference with the UK is now +11 hours. If you're going to call us, 10am UK time is a good time to do so (9pm our time).
