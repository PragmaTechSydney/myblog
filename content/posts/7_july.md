In case anyone looks here to find out about Emily and I, we're both fine. I heard a bomb at about 10am, which apparently was the one on a bus near Russell Square. I passed through Kings Cross about half an hour before whatever happened there (don't know at the time of writing). Emily and I are both in our respective offices and won't be going anywhere until we get the all clear.
