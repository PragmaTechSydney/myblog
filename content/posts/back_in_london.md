Weâ€™ve been back safely in London for nearly two weeks now. Not that much has happened other than catching up with friends and family (very nice), moving all our stuff back into our flat (very stressful) and Emily has started work back at the EBP (very good). I haven't got a job yet, but the market is buoyant and I'm still quite confident I'll get something before Christmas.

It is excellent being properly online again. I've finally been able to listen to [William Shatner's rendition of Common People](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ainyK6fXku0), which I gather has been doing the rounds for a few months. Pure genius.

Will post another update when I've got something more interesting to say.
