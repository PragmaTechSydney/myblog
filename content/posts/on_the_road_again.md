We've been away from home for exactly one year today! And coincidentally, we're finally ready to move on. We leave Sydney on 12 May to begin about six months of travelling (our itinerary is here).

Working these extra few months means we're able to include South America in our plans, which we're both well chuffed about as we probably won't get the chance to go there again for a while. We'll be back in London before Christmas.

Watch this space, more details to follow shortly.
