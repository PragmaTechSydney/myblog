The missus and I spent five day in New York earlier this month – our first excursion by ourselves since the kids were born. We’d both been there a few times before (mostly in the 90s), but I hadn’t visited since October 2001. Too long.

It was just as good as it’s ever been. We roughly split our time equally between old haunts, tourist spots and new places we hadn’t been before and, as you’d expect, it was the new areas which were the most rewarding. We spent the best part of a day wandering round the Lower East Side, including the [newly fashionable BelDel area](http://www.timeout.com/newyork/articles/restaurants-bars/175/south-of-the-border) (Below Delancey Street), as well as Sunday morning in Harlem. Very cool.

I’ve uploaded [a set of photos to my Flickr account](https://www.flickr.com/photos/philliecasablanca/sets/72157603456122538/).
