I gather that the riots in Sydney on Sunday night have made international news. In case you were concerned, we were  unaware of them, they took place a long way from where we live. It's not that far from where I work, but the trouble didn't come close to my office. A London equivalent would be going to work in Liverpool Street after riots in Hackney. Anyway, it all seems to have calmed down now. Although, as far as I know, this is the first time anyone has thought of [stuffing their molotov cocktails with fireworks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2004_Redfern_riots#/media/File:2004_Redfern_riot_fireworks.jpg).
