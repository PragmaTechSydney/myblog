It's damn hot in Bangkok - 40°C, 104°F - but regular showers, drinks and shade-breaks take the edge off.

We can't get over how incredibly cheap things are here. ฿30 (45p) gets you a large, cold beer. ฿350 (GBP5.5) gets you a room for the night. And ฿3.5 (less than 5p) gets you a bus ticket across town!

There are sensational sights, sounds and smells around every corner. We've had a Thai massage from a trainee Monk at [Wat Pho](https://www.flickr.com/photos/philliecasablanca/2050121104/in/album-72157603244442706/), the largest temple in Bangkok. And have eaten hot and spicy Phad Thai for breakfast. Yum!

We're now down in Krabi, Southern Thailand. The weather and scenery are beautiful - if you want to see a picture, click [here](https://www.flickr.com/photos/philliecasablanca/2050121690/in/album-72157603244442706/).

In other news: Phil is growing a beard / can't be bothered to shave. Emily stepped on a dead rat in Khao San, wearing just flip flops (Emily, not the rat). And our tans are coming on nicely (or is it just grime?).

Next step: don't know yet! Smart money is on Ko Pha Ngan, off the East Coast, but we plan to read the guide books in the next few days and make some spontaneous decisions. Quite unlike us, we're sure you'll agree!
