description: Unpicking the channel paradigm

Here in agency land, people often refer to the web as yet another channel. And coming from a background where I was surrounded by developers, this has never sounded right to me.

So when I was invited to present at an internal Loewy-wide event to pimp our Digital wares, I decided to try and describe a better way to think about the web. Iâ€™m giving the talk today, and my slides with notes can be seen on Slideshare [here](https://www.slideshare.net/philwhitehouse/the-web-is-not-a-channel).
