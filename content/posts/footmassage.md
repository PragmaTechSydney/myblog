Since I saw Fergal Sharkey talking at the Mandrake a few weeks ago, I’ve been pondering how the music business is changing. The trailblazers like Radiohead and Prince provide interesting case studies, as they try out new business models. But I don’t think anyone saw this coming – Josh Freese, the drummer for NIN, is selling foot massages with his latest CD, and [that’s just the start of it](https://mashable.com/archive/josh-freese-album-promotion). Brilliant!
