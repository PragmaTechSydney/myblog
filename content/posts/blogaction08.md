Today is Blog Action Day, the day when thousands of blogs around the globe agree to highlight a key issue. Last year it was the environment, this year it’s poverty.

Unfortunately, what with the pressures of a new job n’ all, I haven’t had the time to give this post or topic the effort it deserves. But I do believe that we all have a responsibility to do something about poverty, both home and abroad. There are numerous charities that help make this easy – for instance, why not visit the [Oxfam site](http://www.oxfam.org/en/getinvolved/donate) and set up a monthly donation? It’s as easy as buying a DVD from Amazon. £10 a month goes a long way.
