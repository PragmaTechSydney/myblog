Katie is 48 hours old now, and she's doing just fine. We're trying to gently get her onto a routine (the Gina Ford routine, for those who are interested), and are doing OK. Emily got an hour of proper sleep last night, plus 4 hours of dozing, which is better than we expected! Baby likes to sleep during the day, which is OK, although the plan is to gradually increase the amount of time she sleeps at night instead.

We've had countless emails and text messages which have been fantastic - thanks everyone! We'll get round to contacting you all again as things settle down.
