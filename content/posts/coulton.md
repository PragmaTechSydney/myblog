Can’t quite believe that I hadn’t heard of Jonathan Coulton until recently but, now that I have, I can’t stop listening to him. Funny, geeky, talented and well worth checking out.

Here’s his [official site](http://www.jonathancoulton.com/) where you can try his music for free. But if you like it, please pay the man. I recommend “Tom Cruise Crazy”, “Re: Your Brains”, “The Future Soon” and “That Spells DNA” (DM me if you want more recommendations).

And here is a handy video of “Tom Cruise Crazy”:
