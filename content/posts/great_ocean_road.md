We're back from our holiday down on the South Coast, and it rocked. Kangaroo Island was gorgeous, loads of wildlife to see including pelicans, seals, sea-lions and - surprise! - kangaroos. The Great Ocean Road had several extinct volcanos and amazing coastal scenery to take in. And Melbourne was lovely - pretty chilled out, and the people were very friendly. We also had the chance to catch up with our friends Angie, Grace and Assuntha, who our London friends might remember from a few years back. Our heart still belongs to Sydney though...

And a big thank you goes out to those of you who hoped that Manchester United would beat Arsenal in the semi-final of the F.A.Cup, it seemed to do the trick.....!
