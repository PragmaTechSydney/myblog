Hello!

A bit about me. Having lived in London most of my life, I moved to Sydney in December 2011. Been lovin’ tech all my life though. Rearin’ children since 2005, with no fingers lost so far. Half my family love smoked meat – the other half is a lost cause. Both dogs like meat. And cheese.

I'm a [big fan of Compact Discs](/posts/compactdiscs), and music in general. My long-suffering family will tell you that I have a strong preference for 60s and 70s blues and rock. I play guitar enthusiastically at low-end-to-intermediate level. Member of [The Mistakes](https://www.youtube.com/@mistakes-sydney/videos), a below average cover band. Available for weddings, bar mitzvahs, etc. (you should caveat emptor on that one).

I love travel as you can see from my [Flickr albums](https://www.flickr.com/photos/philliecasablanca/albums), especially going to tech conferences like [SXSW](/posts/sxsw22-part2/). You can find me on [Mastodon](https://mastodon.cloud/@Casablanca). You can bribe me with whisky/whiskey, smoked meat, and craft beer. And get your money back by playing me at poker. Recently started taking acting lessons. Loving it more than I thought I would.

I spent the 90s in marine insurance, which is more interesting than it sounds (ships going bump in the night). Then moved over to tech when the web beckoned, and never looked back. Started as a project manager, and been lucky enough to work with many amazing teams since then. Founder of [PragmaTech](https://pragmatech.sydney), launched and nurtured during Covid, and am also the Chief Digital Officer for [Altai](https://www.altaicasting.com/). On the advisory board for [Nucleotrace](https://www.nucleotrace.tech/). There's more on my [LinkedIn page](https://www.linkedin.com/in/philwhitehouse/).

If you'd like to get in touch, your best bet is to go via one of those social links above, but failing that you can always try [emailing me](mailto:phil.whitehouse@gmail.com). I know email isn’t everyone’s cup of tea, but I’m rather fond of it.

Thanks for visiting!
